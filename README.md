# Flight_Price_Estimation
Flight Price Estimation â€” A practical, end-to-end project that predicts airline ticket prices. I cleaned and engineered features from journey data, built preprocessing pipelines, and trained models (Random Forest, XGBoost). Includes EDA, tuning, evaluation (MAE/RMSE) and a ready-to-run inference notebook.
